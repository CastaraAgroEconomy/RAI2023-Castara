# This sub folder in the "features/Scripts" sub-folder, contains a sub folder
# for the purpose of storing externally scripted feature functions 
# that are essentially in API scripts and are responsible for fetching data 
# from the Weather App, processing it, and making it accessible for the yield estimation scripts.
